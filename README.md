# Projects

I hope this repo will help you along your way. Please don't look at this a code that you can take. You may of course, but I want it to give you insight into projects, ideas, and ways to start formulating your own ideas to make YOURSELF better at coding. It's the approach I take for myself, and I don't know if it's the best, but I definitely like the hands on approach.
